# Vision Dataset Workbench

Vision Dataset Workbench is a local, CPU-friendly command-line foundation for organizing image datasets. It stores a small manifest beside the dataset, imports image metadata without uploading files, and reports basic dataset statistics.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or newer
- No third-party runtime dependencies

## Quick start

```bash
python3 -m vision_workbench init ./workspace
python3 -m vision_workbench add ./workspace ./examples/cat.jpg --label cat
python3 -m vision_workbench summary ./workspace
```

The manifest is written to `.vision-workbench/manifest.json`. Importing the same file twice is idempotent because records are keyed by the file content hash.

## Split plans

A split plan divides every sample currently in the manifest into a
train/validation/test set. Plans are saved under
`.vision-workbench/splits/<name>.json` and never change afterwards.

```bash
python3 -m vision_workbench split create ./workspace baseline \
    --seed 42 --train 0.6 --validation 0.2 --test 0.2
python3 -m vision_workbench split show ./workspace baseline
```

- The three ratios must be finite numbers in `[0, 1]` that sum to exactly
  one; any of them may be zero. Decimals (`0.1`) and fractions (`1/3`) are
  both accepted and handled with exact rational arithmetic.
- Stratification guarantees that, for every class and for the dataset as a
  whole, each set's count differs from its proportional expectation by
  strictly less than one — even for classes with one or two samples.
- Assignments depend only on sample content digests, labels and the seed,
  so they are stable across import order, manifest ordering, workspace
  location and restarts. Samples are listed by digest in each set.
- Unlabeled samples (no label or an empty label) form their own stratum,
  reported under the empty-string key `""`; a real class literally named
  `unlabeled` is kept separate.
- Creating under an existing name reuses the plan only when the seed,
  ratios, sample identities and labels all match; otherwise it reports a
  name conflict and leaves the original untouched.

## Tests

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'
```

## Batch label updates

Labels of already-imported samples can be changed in batches. A batch is a
UTF-8 JSON file:

```json
{
  "batch": "renumber-2026-01",
  "changes": [
    {"sha256": "<full SHA-256 digest>", "old": "cat", "new": "kitten"},
    {"sha256": "<full SHA-256 digest>", "old": "dog", "new": null}
  ]
}
```

- `batch` must be a non-empty string.
- `old` is the expected current label; `new` is the target label. Both may
  be a string or `null`; `null` and the empty string both mean *unlabeled*,
  any other string is taken literally (including Chinese text and a class
  named `unlabeled`).
- The whole batch is verified before anything is written: an unknown
  digest, a sample listed twice, a non-string/non-null label, a malformed
  file, or any sample whose current label differs from its expected old
  label rejects the entire batch with the offending record identified.
- Records whose target equals the current label are no-ops; if every
  record is a no-op, the batch reports `no-changes`, occupies no batch
  number and writes no history.

```bash
python3 -m vision_workbench label ./workspace <digest>      # current label
python3 -m vision_workbench batch ./workspace changes.json   # submit a batch
python3 -m vision_workbench history ./workspace              # successful batches
python3 -m vision_workbench undo ./workspace <batch-number>  # undo a batch
```

Submitting the same number with the same content again returns the
original result without re-modifying anything (list order and the
`null`/`""` spelling do not change the content), even if labels were
changed in the meantime. The same number with different content is a
conflict.

`history` lists successful batches in submission order: the samples
involved, their before/after labels, and the number of samples actually
changed. Failed batches never enter history.

`undo` restores the old labels of a batch, but only for samples the batch
actually changed and only when none of them was modified afterwards (even
if the label was changed back). Other samples' later changes do not block
the undo. Undo leaves a queryable record; repeating it reports
`already-undone`.

Batch writes and undos are crash-safe: a write-ahead journal installs the
manifest and the history together, so reopening after an interruption
shows either the old state or the complete new state with its history.
Concurrent submissions are serialized by a workspace lock, so no
successful batch is lost and two batches modifying the same sample from
the same old label cannot both win. Saved split plans are never touched
by label changes; plans created afterwards use the current labels, and
the same-name reuse/conflict rules still apply.
